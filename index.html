                    <h2>MEET MR. TED</h2>
                        <h3>After nearly three decades in pet food retail, Mr. Ted threw all caution to the wind and enrolled in a crash course in building security and maintenance.</h3>
                        <p>
                        One night, on his beat at Janklow and Nesbit in Manhattan, he discovered the joys of literature. Applying himself with relish to his new-found calling, Ted immediately secured the rights to The Golden Diatribes of Dr. Jothi Parbinder (an Indian self-help guru also working the security beat at Janklow and Nesbit.) In a matter of days, the two literary mavericks were renting an office in Hackettstown, New Jersey, determined to change literature forever.</p>
                        <p>Ted Jothi Literary Associates closed its doors in less than a month when Dr. Parbinder vanished after mysteriously reverse-charging 10 years of unpaid electricity bills he’d discovered in an office filing cabinet back to Jersey Central Power & Light, landing Mr. Ted in the pen for three years.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        In prison, Mr. Ted struck up a literary correspondence with author Max Sheridan, who had by chance written a 5-star review of the Golden Diatribes for Dr. Parbinder in exchange for two 3-star reviews of his first novel, an agreement Parbinder never honored. 
                        When Ted was released from prison at the age of 52, a licensed pastor, he convinced Sheridan to let him manage his transatlantic literary career in exchange for a 5% cut and his assistance in tracking down their mutual nemesis, Dr. Parbinder — who at the time still owed Sheridan his two 3-star reviews.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Today, Mr. Ted is more devoted than ever to advancing the literary careers of a select clientele. While he focuses primarily on self-help, sports, conspiracy theories, sci-fi, detective series, professional gambling memoirs, YA, horror, speculative and literary fiction, illustrated children’s books, feminism, trans and non-binary authors, diaspora voices, dissident literatures, and diet and nutrition manuals, with the occasional foray into self-published genealogies, Tarot and Cabala guides, and pet care, he is really open to anything with a fresh perspective and a solid market.
                        </p>
